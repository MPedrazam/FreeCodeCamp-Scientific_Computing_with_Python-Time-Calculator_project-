# FreeCodeCamp---Scientific-Computing-with-Python---Time-Calculator_project
The aim of this project is to write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

    - a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
    - a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
    - a starting day of the week, case insensitive

The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result. More information about the project guidelines can be find in this link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator
